# Ico persize thumbnailer for GNU/Linux
Thumbnailer for Windows ico files, that extracts the closest format to a preview resoliution.

I do not know if there are still file managers that create thumbnails of files smaller than 128x128, but if there are, then this thumbnail is made for them! It creates thumbnails from the formats embedded in the Windows ICO icon closest to the required preview resolution.
